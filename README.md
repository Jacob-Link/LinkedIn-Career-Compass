## 🏃 How To Run
Follow these steps to get the application running: 
1. Download the `run_qualification_prediction_app.ipynb` notebook.
2. Upload notebook to DataBricks environment.
3. Press the "**▶️ Run all**" button located at the top right of the page.
4. Change the input to the app, using the widgets located at the top left side of the screen: **User ID**, **Selected Position**, **Salary Expectation** and run the last cell in the notebook to see the output change based on the chosen inputs.
